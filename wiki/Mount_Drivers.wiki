== 1. Driver "API" ==

Mount drivers are composed of two functions: `mountfs` and `umountfs`. They are called at the beginning and end of the backup process. Mount drivers can also be used to perform database dumps. Function prototypes:

{{{
#Mounting function
function mountfs($user, $server, $volume, $mountpoint="")
 {
  #Your code here
 }

#Umount function
function umountfs($user, $server, $volume, $mountpoint="")
 {
  #Your code here
 }
}}}

*NOTE:* Mount driver files must have names ending in `-roo` or they will not be called.

*NOTE:* Due to a bug, the 4th argument is not actually passed to the driver, so it should be an optional argument.
