 1. Run ./install
 2. Read TUTORIAL
 3. Modify the example configuration file to your needs
 4. Set up the environment
 5. Try it out!

To upgrade or move an installation of alpine-backup, do not simply rsync it around; use the ./install script. It modifies alpine-backup 
to use the correct paths for the local environment and makes sure there are no old-style configuration declarations hanging around.

NOTE: The install script overwrites the utils/ and lib/ directories, so make sure to back them up and restore as needed.
